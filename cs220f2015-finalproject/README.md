This is the repository where I've kept all of the source code for a class project that was done in conjunction with another classmate. Here, we describe some of the basic features of Scala and write some sample programs to demonstrate these features. I've chosen this project because I want to showcase how easily I can pick up other languages---I learned Python on my own over the summer (Python makes a small cameo), and I learned Scala in the two weeks it took to do this project. 

Feel free to ask any questions about these code samples!
